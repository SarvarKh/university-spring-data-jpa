## Built With

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) - an open source Java-based framework used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.
- [PostgreSQL / Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - an open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) - provides repository support for the Java Persistence API (JPA)
- [Hibernate]()
- [Maven (frontend plugin)](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) & [Maven (resources plugin)](https://github.com/apache/maven-resources-plugin) - a build automation tool
- [IntelliJ IDEA ultimate & JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - the IDE for Spring development
- [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)/[CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css)

## Following concepts have been covered:

- What is Spring Data JPA
- Connect to a real database and not in memory DB
- How to map classes to tables
- Hibernate Entity Life Cycle
- Queries
- Paging and Sorting
- 1 to 1 Relationships
- 1 to Many Relationships
- Many to Many relationships
- Transactions


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup
    Step 1: git clone https://github.com/SarvarKh/university-spring-data-jpa.git
    
    Step 2 - navigate to the cloned directory:
